# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This repository has two main modules:
- `backend/`: Spring Boot API service. Core Java code is in `backend/src/main/java/com/example/demo`, configuration is in `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties`, and tests are in `backend/src/test/java/com/example/demo`.
- `frontend/`: uni-app Vue client. Pages live in `frontend/pages/` (current entry: `pages/index/index.vue`), shared assets are in `frontend/static/`, and app-level config files are `pages.json`, `manifest.json`, and `uni.scss`.

Treat `backend/target/` and `frontend/unpackage/` as generated output; do not edit them manually.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `cd backend && mvn spring-boot:run`: start the backend locally.
- `cd backend && mvn test`: run backend JUnit tests.
- `cd backend && mvn clean package`: build the backend artifact.
- `cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev:h5`: run the frontend in H5 mode (as documented in `README.md`).

If frontend npm scripts are not available in your local setup, run the uni-app project through your IDE workflow and keep output behavior consistent with `dev:h5`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Java: use 4-space indentation, `PascalCase` class names, `camelCase` methods/fields, and lowercase package names (for example `com.example.demo.controller`).
- Keep REST controllers under `.../controller` and route paths under `/api/*`.
- Vue/uni-app: follow existing tab-indented `.vue` style, keep page directories lowercase (for example `pages/index`), and keep static assets under `frontend/static`.

## Testing Guidelines
- Backend testing uses JUnit 5 with Spring Boot Test (`spring-boot-starter-test`).
- Place tests in mirrored package paths under `backend/src/test/java`.
- Name test classes with a `*Tests` suffix (example: `DemoApplicationTests`).
- Run `mvn test` before pushing backend changes.

No automated frontend test suite is configured currently; include a manual smoke-test note for UI changes.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Current history uses short messages (examples: `初始化模版`, `first commit`). Keep commits concise and imperative; prefer `<area>: <summary>` when possible (example: `backend: add hello endpoint validation`).

For PRs, include:
- What changed and why.
- Which module(s) were touched (`backend`, `frontend`, or both).
- Verification performed (commands run, plus screenshots for UI changes).
- Linked issue/task and any config changes.
